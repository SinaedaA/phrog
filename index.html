                <h2>What is a phrog?</h2>

                <p>According to the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/phrog">Wiktionary</a>, a Phrog is a 
                    <q>Deliberate misspelling of frog</q>...
                    However, this is a slanderous definition of the word Phrog, which encompasses a group of complex living creatures, that are very different from regular frogs.</p>
                <p><em>So what is a Phrog?</em>
                    <blockquote>A phrog is a frog that is also a phish. It is a phrog.</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>Phrogs can be described in a great number of ways:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>They are green</li>
                    <li>They are slimy</li>
                    <li>They are cute</li>
                    <li>They are phishy</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Their scientific name is <i>Phrogus phrogibus</i>.</p>

                <p>Some educational videos about phrogs exist 
                    on the interwebs. However, the most scientifically accurate was made by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tootymcnooty3485">NootyMcNooty</a>.

                <h2>How does a phrog differ from a ferg?</h2>
                <p>A <strong>ferg</strong> is similar to a phrog, but it is slightly more childish. It also comes in different shapes and sizes, as this informative chart can prove to you.</p>
