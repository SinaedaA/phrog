            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Phrogs are scaredy little creatures, and will avoid being caught in the wild, as they are known to enjoy their freedom very much...</p>
            <p>
                However, once you earn their trust, they are very <strong>loyal</strong> friends to have. 
                A little bit of patience and a lot of love (as well as some bait) is all you need to catch a phrog.
                So, let's get started !

                <p>
                    Phrogs won't accept just any type of bait. Usually, they enjoy to eat

                    foods. Butterflies ü¶ã, broccoli ü•¶, mangos ü•≠, apples (üçé or üçè), roses üåπ, but also grapes üçá and caterpillars üêõ are part of their favourite snacks (and also essential diet).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you go out to catch a phrog, make sure to bring some of these foods with you. 
                    If you are not willing to harm animals in order to catch a Phrog, just know that Phrogs are very happy to live on a plant-based diet as well. 
                    Bring any piece of colorful fruit with you, preferably ones with a strong smell (like mangos and pineapples), in order to attract the wild Phrog to you. 
                    Once you have the Phrog's attention, you can start feeding it and gain its trust.

            <h2 id="Luring_phrog">Step 2: Luring the Phrog</h2>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, Phrogs won't be lured by the smell of food alone. 
                    If you are even unable to find one in the wild, two things can help you:
                    <!-- description list -->
                    <dl>
                        <dt><strong><mark>Change the search location: </mark></strong></dt>
                            <dd> 
                            Indeed some locations are completely avoided by Phrogs.
                            For example, they have a preference for wet or damp habitats, like rivers and ponds, because one of their favourite activities is swimming.
                            Of course, it is possible that you find some Phrogs wandering about in the forest, but on a hot day ‚òÄÔ∏è they will definitely not spend a lot of time outside of the water...
                            </dd>
                        
                        <dt><strong><mark>Use a Phrog call: </mark></strong></dt> 
                            <dd>
                            Phrogs are very social animals, and they will respond to the call of another Phrog. 
                            If you are able to mimic the sound of a Phrog, you might be able to attract one to you. Click on this <button>button</button> to hear the call of a Phrog.
                            However, be careful, as some Phrogs are very territorial and might not appreciate the intrusion of another Phrog in their territory.
                            </dd>
                            <p></p>
                        <dt><strong>NB: <em>what to do when a Phrog wants to fight you?</strong></em></dt>
                            <dd>
                            You will have to use a special technique to show that you are here <strong>in PEACE</strong> ‚òÆÔ∏è. 
                            Indeed, there is <strong>no way</strong> you will win this fight, as Phrogs are trained from a very young age in several martial arts disciplines.
                            So, <em>how do you show you mean them no harm?</em> That's easy, just bow down to the Phrog and show them your belly. 
                            If they look skeptical, you can rub your belly to show them you are not a threat.
                            </dd>
